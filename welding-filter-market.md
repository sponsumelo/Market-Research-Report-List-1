<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The welding filter market is categorized into active and passive types. Active welding filters automatically adjust their shading according to the brightness of the arc, providing enhanced visibility and protection. They offer convenience and reduce eye strain during welding. Passive welding filters, on the other hand, maintain a fixed level of shade and require manual adjustment. While they are generally more affordable, they may not offer the same level of comfort and adaptability as active filters, making them suitable for basic applications.</p></p>
